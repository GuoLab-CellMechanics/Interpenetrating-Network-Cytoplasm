# interpenetrating-network cytoplasm

This repository contains example code and mesh files for the finite element implementation of the finite-deformation 
continuum-mechanical theory with a multi-branch visco-hyperelastic constitutive relation coupled with phase-field damage 
and healing which we developed for modeling the mechanical behavior of eukaryotic cytoplasm in our paper:

Specifically, this code generates the curves of Figure 3(b) in the paper.

You can also run the example code on Google Colab. [Click here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1l_mnUT0iHaf_Zb49LnDSFyijdAPH1Uw3?usp=sharing)
